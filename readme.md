## Summary of the data
This short report was written with the data obtained from Institutional Research at LaGuardia Community College on Wednesday, July 5, 2023. The data included information on the languages spoken by LaGuardia students during every fall semester between 2016 and 2022.

Below is a brief summary of the current state of linguistic diversity at LaGuardia Community College. The actual data can be found right below the summary.

- Most students did not respond to the survey item on home/primary language. The "no response" rate was 43.9% in Fall 2016, which increased to 89.6% by Fall 2022. As of Fall 2022, it's fair to say that we practically do not know the current state of linguistic diversity at LaGuardia.
- Between Fall 2016 and Fall 2022, 119 different languages have been documented. However, the majority of languages (over 90 languages) are spoken by less than 0.1% of the student body and, in some cases, are spoken only by a single student.
- While 119 languages are recorded, not all languages were represented in each academic year. Small languages, typically those spoken only by one student, were recorded only for a few years within the duration of the data collection time.
- Among those who responded to the survey item on languages, the majority of students (53.8% - 60.5%) speak English as their primary language. The proportion of English speakers is slowly increasing over the years (53.8% in Fall 2016 to 60.5% in Fall 2022).
- After English, Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language at LaGuardia. Like other non-English languages, the proportion of Spanish speakers is decreasing over the years (21.0% in Fall 2016 to 18.6% in Fall 2022).
- The number of languages found at LaGuardia each year has decreased from 97 (in Fall 2016) to 54 (in Fall 2022). This is somewhat surprising given that linguistic diversity has been on an increasing trend in New York City (and in the U.S.). The decline in the number of languages at LaGuardia is probably due to a smaller sample size over the years, resulting in missing a lot of languages that are spoken by a small number of students (sometimes only one student).
